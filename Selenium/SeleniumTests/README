To run the test cases right click on each test cases and run as TestNG

I could only write 3 test cases
but each of them are different and I have also used POM model and also used baseTest which is common for all
test cases

The first test case is simple validates the title
Second one is fill form of watchDemo
Third one is to compare the expiration of the pricings
